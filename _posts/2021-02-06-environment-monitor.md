#IoT Home Environmental Alerting

Internet of Things (IoT) is an ever expanding field and one of the most common things to do is environmental alerting.  To do that, this tutorial uses the [Twilio Developer Kit for Broadband IoT](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iot/wireless/get-started-twilio-developer-kit-broadband-iot) to monitor for temperature, humidity, and liquid and sends an SMS alerting you to conditions that are outside your desired parameters. The developer kit allows you to be connected to the cellular network, allowing for monitoring at more remote locations.
